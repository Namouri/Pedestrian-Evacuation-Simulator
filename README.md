# EvacuationPlan_simulation
A Java‑based evacuation simulation using BFS pathfinding and agent‑based modeling. Built in a layered architecture with a focus on clean design, modularity, and clear separation of logic.

🚀 Features
Agent‑based movement on a 2D grid

BFS pathfinding to find optimal escape routes

Start/stop/reset simulation controls

Layered architecture (UI, logic, data)

Real‑time visualization of agent behavior

🛠️ Tech Stack Java

IntelliJ IDEA

BFS algorithm

Object‑oriented design

Agent‑based simulation

▶️ How to Run
Open the project in IntelliJ

Build the project

Run the main class to start the simulation
